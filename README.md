# SAM Styles

## Fractal

We're using [Fractal](http://fractal.build) to generate an interactive component library for the design system. You can run it locally after `npm install` with:

```sh
npm start
```

Then, visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the design system in action.

_**Optional**: To re-build when CSS changes are made, run the following command from the project directory in a separate terminal window:_
```sh
npm run watch
```
