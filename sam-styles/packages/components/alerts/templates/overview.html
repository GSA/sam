    The alerts component in Sam Styles is a reusable component that displays a list of alerts. It is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their own projects and tailor it to their specific needs.</br>
    The alerts component can be used to display a variety of types of alerts, including error messages, warnings, and informational messages. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface for displaying these alerts, with customizable styling options to match the look and feel of your application. </br></br>
    Informational (info) alerts: These alerts are used to provide users with non-critical information about their actions or the system. They are typically used to confirm that an action has been completed successfully, to provide helpful tips or suggestions, or to provide updates about the system or application. Examples of when to use info alerts include when a user submits a form successfully, when a new feature is added to the application, or when the system undergoes maintenance.</br></br>

Warning alerts: Warning alerts are used to alert users about potential problems or issues that may arise. They are typically used to indicate that something has gone wrong, but that the user can still take corrective action to prevent further problems. Examples of when to use warning alerts include when a user enters invalid data into a form, when a user is about to perform an action that may have unintended consequences, or when there is a temporary problem with the system that will be resolved shortly.</br></br>

Error alerts: Error alerts are used to indicate that a critical problem has occurred and that the user cannot continue without addressing the issue. They are typically used to notify users about errors that prevent them from completing an action or that could result in data loss or other serious consequences. Examples of when to use error alerts include when a user enters incorrect login credentials, when a server error occurs, or when a form submission fails due to missing or invalid data.</br></br>

It's important to use these types of alerts appropriately and consistently throughout your application to ensure that users understand the severity of the message and can take appropriate action. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your application is user-friendly and easy to use, while also providing users with the information they need to make informed decisions.
