	<p class="usa-intro">Signing up will give you an individual user account.  
	You register an entity before applying for a grant or bidding on a contract. </p>
	<p>Signing up is a simple process where you provide an email address and password, and choose 
	an option for multi-factor authentication. We will send you to login.gov to sign up for 
	a user account and every time you sign in.
	</p>
	<p>Registering is a more involved process where you enter in many details about your business, 
		government organization, hospital, university, or other entity.  You should start registration
		at least two weeks before you need your registration to be active.  We recommend starting 
		30 days early.
