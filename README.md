## Fractal

We're using [Fractal](http://fractal.build) to generate an interactive component library for sam-styles. You can run it locally after `npm install` with:

```sh
npm start
```

Then, visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see sam-styles in action.

To re-build when CSS changes are made, run the following command from the project directory in a separate terminal window:
```sh
npm run prod
```
