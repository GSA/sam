## How to use

Sam-styles icons are designed to be used with FontAwesome, so all styling options(rotation, animation, transforms, layering, etc.) are also available in sam-styles.

To use sam-styles icons, you need to know two bits of information to reference an icon.
1. its name, prefixed with `fa-` and
2. the style's prefix for sam-styles

```html
<i class="sds fa-bell"></i> <!-- this icon's name is `bell` and sam-styles prefix is 'sds' -->
```
